     * - If the device sends an explicit motion byte (payload v2), trust it.
     * - Otherwise (v1, the current firmware) DERIVE it from [confidencePercent].
     *   Confidence = ML confidence × IMU trust, and maternal movement pulls IMU trust — and
     *   therefore confidence — down (this is also stated in the BLE spec: "if motion is
     *   WALKING, confidence will be low because the signal is unreliable during movement").
     *   So high confidence ⇒ still, lower ⇒ movement. This keeps the payload at 8 bytes —
     *   no extra IMU bytes on the wire — and does the contextualising on the phone, which is
     *   the only place with the thresholds. The [signalLow] flag, when the firmware sets it,
     *   is a direct "movement/unreliable" signal and forces WALKING.
     *
     *   NOTE: this is an approximation — confidence also drops on genuine ML uncertainty, not
     *   only movement. A dedicated motion byte (v2) is more precise; until then this is the
     *   honest best-effort from the bytes we have.
